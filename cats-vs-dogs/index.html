	<h2>Dogs Have Better Noses</h2>

	<p>
		Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million 		times lower than humans can. The wet nose is essential for 		determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. 		Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by 		evaporation of the moisture by air currents.

	<h2>Cats Have Better Tongues</h2>
	
	<p>
		Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking 		their coats. The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 		micrometers long, which are called papillae. These are quite rigid, as 		they contain keratin. These spines allow cats to groom themselves by 		licking their fur, with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush.
