			<li>2 onions, grated or very finely choppedl</li>
			<li>2 to 3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
			<li>&frac12; tsp crushed saffron threads or saffron powdel </li>
			<li>&frac14;- &frac12; teaspoon ground ginger</li>
			<li>1 chicken, cut up in 6 or 8 pieces</li>
			<li>Salt and black pepper</li>
			<li>Juice of &frac12; lemon</li>
			<li>2 tbsp chopped coriander</li>
			<li>2 tbsp chopped flat leaf parsley</li>

			<li>In a wide casserole or heavy-bottomed pan that can hold all the 			chicken pieces in one layer, heat the oil and put in the onions. Saute, 			stirring over low heat until they soften, then stir in the garlic, 			saffron and ginger.</li>
			
			<li>Put in the chicken pieces, season with salt and pepper, and pour in 			about 1 &frac14; cups water. Simmer, covered, turning the pieces over a few 			times and adding a little water if it becomes too dry. Lift out the breasts 			after about 15 minutes and put them to one side. Continue to cook the 			remaining pieces for another 25 minutes or so, after which time return the 			breasts to the pan.</li>
											  
			<li>Stir into the sauce the lemon juice, the chopped coriander and 			parsley, the preserved lemon peel cut into quarters or strips, and the 			olives. Simmer uncovered for 5-10 minutes, until the reduced sauce is 			thick and unctuous. If there is too much liquid, lift out the chicken pieces 			and set aside while you reduce the sauce further, then return the chicken to 			the pan and heat through.</li>
			
			<li>Present the chicken on a serving dish with the olives and lemon peel 			on top of the meat.</li>
