						  <li>In a wide casserole or heavy-bottomed pan that can hold all the chicken pieces in one layer, heat the oil and put in the onions. Sauté, stirring over low heat until they soften, then stir in the garlic, saffron and ginger.</li>
						  					  <li>Put in the chicken pieces, season with salt and pepper, and pour in about 1 1⁄4 cups water. Simmer, covered, turning the pieces over a few times and adding a little water if it becomes too dry. Lift out the breasts after about 15 minutes and put them to one side. Continue to cook the remaining pieces for another 25 minutes or so, after which time return the breasts to the pan.</li>
											  
<li>Stir into the sauce the lemon juice, the chopped coriander and parsley, the preserved lemon peel cut into quarters or strips, and the olives. Simmer uncovered for 5–10 minutes, until the reduced sauce is thick and unctuous. If there is too much liquid, lift out the chicken pieces and set aside while you reduce the sauce further, then return the chicken to the pan and heat through.</li>
